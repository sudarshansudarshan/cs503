1. **What if I am unable to make it to a class?**

   It is important that you don't miss the classes as much as possible. Note that we are dropping 10% of your quiz and tests considering that you won't be able to attend all the classes. You also have the option of choosing the comprehensive evaluation track. 

1. **I am not keeping well and I wont be able to attend the class/quiz/test, can you please help me with a re-quiz/re-test?**

    Respecting the exceptions that can occur, we are dropping 10% of the quiz and test marks. If you miss more than 10% of it, you are risking your marks. There wont be any re-quizzes or re-tests. If you miss the minor and major exam, institute rules will apply.  


1. **I am unable to see the board from the seat assigned to me. Can you please help?**

    Please feel free to talk to the instructor and ask him for a seat assignment in the front row. We will be happy to help.


1. **Is attendance compulsory?**
   
   No, but attendance will be taken for documentation reasons. If you are regular to the classes, the instructor may consider giving you some discretionary grace marks of at most 5. We strongly recommend that you attend all the classes. 

1. **The entire class would request for an off for a genuine reason. Is this possible?**
   
   Any request to cancel the class should be intimated at least 1 week in advance with a clear date of the compensatory class which is convenient for the instructor and all the students. The request should come through the course committee Chair. 

1. **How do I give my best in the course?**

   Please attend all the classes without fail. Effort required to prepare for the exams, is many folds less, if one regularly attends the classes and gives their best in quiz/tests. 

1. **I understand we should be on time for the class. How many minutes of delay is allowed?**

   We expect you to be in the class before the class commences. The door closes 120 seconds after the commencement of classes. We want to discourage it in the interest of the class. Coming late for the class disturbs the entire class cognitively. 

1. **How do I share my feedback with the instructor?** 
   
   We have a [link to a google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbTmPY_GurY-UAc0sHV4lhfyqvs1SLCiJocWYhqtQFpP1c-g/viewform?usp=sf_link) which can be used to share your feedback with the instructor. This will be an anonymous form.

1. **What is the prescribed textbook for the course?**

   There is no one prescribed text for the course. You should use the content on the course homepage. Many standard and most frequently used textbooks are quite dated.

1. **I was off to represent the institute in so and so event. Can you please show me the answer script at a later point of time?**

   We are sorry. This won’t be possible as this will add to our complexity given the big classroom. If you are not around during the first week after the exam, we won’t be able to show you the answer script. We can however show you, if you can come forward to take part in a TA related administrative work for three hours which involves programming a script for google sheets or by redeeming 10 health points.

1. **I am not around to check the answer sheet, can I ask my friend to check on my behalf?**

   This is not officially possible. It is your duty to ensure that you are around to see your answer scripts. Showing your answer scripts to your friends can land you and us into unnecessary troubles. What if your friend inadvertently writes something on the answer script? Who will be responsible? While we are strict about this rule, in case of medical emergency, you can produce a medical certificate and ask the Head TA to help you with an alternate arrangement.
