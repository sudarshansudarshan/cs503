# Grading

You are gauranteed to get a grade based on your absolute total as described below :

| Score Range  | Grade Number |
|--------------|--------------|
| 95 and above | 10           |
| 90 - 94      | 9            |
| 85 - 89      | 8            |
| 80 - 84      | 7            |
| 70 - 79      | 6            |
| 60 - 69      | 5            |
| 50 - 59      | 4            |
|  0 - 49      | 3            |

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The instructor will strictly follow the above rule to assign grades based on absolute grading. There is a small possibility that the instructor may consider relative grading if the highest score doesn't cross an acceptable threshold. In that case, your grade will be the best of Relative Grade and Absolute Grade.

# Health of the Class
We will be maintaining a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12qDBpHmaFjYkjZ0mkHDWFJhtg4ZauA3eTo0NPHRyrUM/edit#gid=0)  which will be updated after every class. In case the health crosses some pre-defined thresholds, there will be perks and incentives that the entire class will enjoy. The details on the points vs perks:


| Points                |Rank                                | Perks  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|--------|

| 80 or above  | Rank 5 | 80 % of quiz and test will be considered|
| 90 or above  | Rank 4 | Track 3, which is only final exam marks. We will consider the best of three tracks|
|100 or above  | Rank 3 | 66.66% of quiz and test will be considered|
|120 or above  | Rank 2 | bonus of 5 marks|
|140 or above  | Rank 1 | Grade Upgrade|


Note that a superior rank will include the perks of all the lower ranks too. For instance, if you are rank 1, then you will get the perks of all the 6 ranks. If you are rank 2, then you get the perks of rank 2-6 and so on.
