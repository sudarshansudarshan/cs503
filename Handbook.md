# Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;">

Machine learning has revolutionized the field of computing, transforming algorithms from static processes to dynamic entities capable of learning, adapting, and inferring. This course, designed to reflect the rapid advancements and growing importance of machine learning, takes a comprehensive and applied approach to this fascinating subject. Our goal is to blend modern methodologies with rigorous mathematical foundations, ensuring a deep and practical understanding of machine learning. We emphasize an applied approach throughout the course, ensuring that theoretical concepts are consistently linked to real-world applications. Students will engage in hands-on projects and practical exercises that reinforce the material covered in lectures.

# Expectations from the course

<p style="text-align: justify;">

Our primary goal is to equip students with the essential skills to understand and navigate the complex mathematical foundations of machine learning. We emphasize a skill-based approach to foster deep comprehension over rote memorization. Success in this course requires consistent practice, regular attendance, active participation, and diligent preparation for assignments and exams. Engage deeply with hands-on projects and practical exercises, and take initiative in exploring additional resources and seeking help when needed. Your commitment to these expectations will build the confidence and proficiency necessary to excel in this transformative field.

# Grading

You are gauranteed to get a grade based on your absolute total as described below :

| Score Range  | Grade Number |
|--------------|--------------|
| 95 and above | 10           |
| 90 - 94      | 9            |
| 85 - 89      | 8            |
| 80 - 84      | 7            |
| 70 - 79      | 6            |
| 60 - 69      | 5            |
| 50 - 59      | 4            |
|  0 - 49      | 3            |

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The instructor will strictly follow the above rule to assign grades based on absolute grading. There is a small possibility that the instructor may consider relative grading if the highest score doesn't cross an acceptable threshold. In that case, your grade will be the best of Relative Grade and Absolute Grade.

# Securing a Pass Grade

Complete the Engagement quiz take up a viva voce and you will be assured of at least a D in the course.

# Project

We will soon be announcing the details over an email and we will populate this section after that.

# Health of the Class
We will be maintaining a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12qDBpHmaFjYkjZ0mkHDWFJhtg4ZauA3eTo0NPHRyrUM/edit#gid=0)  which will be updated after every class. In case the health crosses some pre-defined thresholds, there will be perks and incentives that the entire class will enjoy. The details on the points vs perks:


| Points                |Rank                                | Perks  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|--------|
| 80 or above  | Rank 5 | 80 % of quiz and test will be considered|
| 90 or above  | Rank 4 | Track 3, which is only final exam marks. We will consider the best of three tracks|
|100 or above  | Rank 3 | 66.66% of quiz and test will be considered|
|120 or above  | Rank 2 | bonus of 5 marks|
|140 or above  | Rank 1 | Grade Upgrade|


Note that a superior rank will include the perks of all the lower ranks too. For instance, if you are rank 1, then you will get the perks of all the 6 ranks. If you are rank 2, then you get the perks of rank 2-6 and so on.
