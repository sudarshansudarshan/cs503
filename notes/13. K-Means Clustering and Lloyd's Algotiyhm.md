# K-Means Clustering and Lloyd's Algorithm  

---

**Overview of Lloyd's Algorithm**  

**Context and Terminology**  

This lecture introduces **Lloyd's Algorithm**, commonly called the **K-Means Algorithm**, a popular approach to clustering in unsupervised learning. The objective of the K-Means problem is to partition a dataset into **$$ k $$ clusters**, each represented by a central point or "mean." Lloyd's algorithm iteratively approximates a solution to this problem.

**Steps of Lloyd’s Algorithm**  

**Step 1: Initialization**  

To begin clustering, we assign each data point a **cluster indicator** $$ z $$ as an initial label. This initialization step can be arbitrary but affects the final result and convergence speed. Each data point $$ x_i $$ is assigned a random $$ z_i \in \{1, \dots, k\} $$ that identifies its initial cluster.

**Step 2: Compute the Mean (Centroid)**  

In each iteration, for every cluster $$ k $$, calculate the **centroid** $$ \mu_k $$ by averaging the data points assigned to it. This centroid update for each cluster $$ k $$ can be expressed as:

$$
\mu_k^{(t)} = \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{x_i \in C_k} x_i
$$

where $$ C_k $$ is the set of all data points currently assigned to cluster $$ k $$.

**Step 3: Reassignment Step**  

After updating centroids, each data point \($$ x_i $$\) is reassigned to the cluster with the nearest mean. The cluster indicator $$ z_i $$ is updated as:

$$
z_i = \underset{k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \| x_i - \mu_k^{(t)} \|^2
$$

This step ensures that each point moves towards the cluster that minimizes its distance to the centroid.

**Convergence and Termination**  

**Convergence Criteria**  

The algorithm iterates until **convergence**, defined as a state where no points change clusters. This can occur when each point's distance to its current cluster centroid is less than or equal to the distance to any other centroid.

1. **Convergence Check**: If, in a given iteration, no points are reassigned to different clusters, the algorithm terminates.
2. **Loop Prevention**: Lloyd's algorithm avoids infinite loops by consistently reducing the **sum of squared errors (SSE)** with each iteration. Thus, convergence is guaranteed, although it may not always reach the global optimum.

**Potential Limitations**  

While Lloyd's algorithm is guaranteed to converge, it may not find the optimal clustering. The converged solution can depend heavily on the **initialization** and might only be a **local minimum**. This limitation is a trade-off due to the problem's NP-hard nature.

**Example Walkthrough: A K-Means Cycle**  

1. **Initialize clusters**: Randomly assign data points to initial clusters.
2. **Compute Centroids**: Calculate centroids for each cluster based on current assignments.
3. **Reassign Points**: Reassign each data point to the closest centroid.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the compute-reassign cycle until convergence.

This process illustrates how points iteratively move closer to centroids, forming tight clusters.

**Key Questions on Lloyd’s Algorithm**  

**Q1: Does the Algorithm Converge?**  

Yes, Lloyd's algorithm is proven to converge since it decreases the SSE in each iteration. However, convergence depends on the initialization and may lead to suboptimal clusters.

**Q2: What Kind of Clusters Does It Produce?**  

Lloyd’s algorithm tends to create compact, spherical clusters but may struggle with datasets that have varying densities or non-spherical shapes.

**Q3: How Should Initialization Be Performed?**  

Initialization can impact results significantly. Common techniques include **random selection** or methods like **K-Means++** for smarter initial placement of centroids to improve convergence quality.

**Q4: How Do We Choose $$ k $$?**  

The number of clusters $$ k $$ is often unknown and determined by **evaluation metrics** like the **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score** to assess the best number of clusters based on dataset characteristics.

**Key Takeaways**  

- Lloyd's algorithm is a popular heuristic for clustering, especially useful for quick approximations.
- Despite limitations like sensitivity to initialization and local minima, it produces reasonable clusters in practice.
- Selecting $$ k $$ and initializing centroids are key to improving the performance of the algorithm.
