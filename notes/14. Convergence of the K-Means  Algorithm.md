## Convergence of the K-Means Algorithm  


**Introduction to K-Means Convergence**  

**Overview**  

This lecture delves into the **convergence properties of Lloyd’s Algorithm** (often known as the K-Means Algorithm) for clustering, specifically answering whether and how this algorithm reaches a stable state where no further cluster reassignments are necessary.

**Key Questions on Convergence**  

1. **Does the Lloyd's Algorithm converge?**
2. **If it converges, what type of clusters does it produce?**
3. **What effect does initialization have on the clustering results?**
4. **How should we choose the number of clusters, $$ k $$?**

This session primarily focuses on the first question: proving that Lloyd's Algorithm does indeed converge.

**Mathematical Proof of Convergence**  

**Step 1: Establishing the Objective Function**  

The objective function $$ J $$ is defined as the sum of squared Euclidean distances from each point to its cluster centroid. For a given set of cluster assignments, $$ J $$ is calculated as:

$$
J = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \| x_i - \mu_{z_i} \|^2
$$

where $$ \mu_{z_i} $$ is the centroid of the cluster that data point $$ x_i $$ is currently assigned to.

**Step 2: Iterative Reassignment**  

In each iteration, the algorithm performs two main steps:

1. **Update Centroids**: Calculate new centroids $$ \mu_k $$ for each cluster.
   $$
   \mu_k = \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{x_i \in C_k} x_i
   $$
   where $$ C_k $$ is the set of all data points currently assigned to cluster $$ k $$.
   
2. **Reassign Points**: For each point $$ x_i $$, update its cluster assignment $$ z_i $$ to the nearest centroid:
   $$
   z_i = \underset{k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \| x_i - \mu_k \|^2
   $$

**Step 3: Reduction of the Objective Function**  

Each reassignment strictly reduces the objective function $$ J $$. This is due to a fundamental property of Euclidean distance: the sum of squared distances of points to their own cluster's centroid is minimized when points are assigned to the nearest centroid.

**Step 4: Finite Number of Partitions**  

Since there are only a finite number of possible cluster assignments, the algorithm must eventually reach a state where **no further improvements** (reassignments) are possible, thus leading to convergence.

**Key Insight: Why Convergence Happens**  

The convergence of the Lloyd's Algorithm is based on two core ideas:

1. **Objective Function Minimization**: With each iteration, $$ J $$ decreases, ensuring that the algorithm does not revisit previous partitions.
2. **Finite Partition Possibilities**: There is a finite number of ways to partition $$ n $$ data points into $$ k $$ clusters, so continual reassignment cannot go on indefinitely.

**Implications of Convergence**  

- **Local Minima**: Convergence does not guarantee the global minimum of the objective function. The solution reached is often a local minimum, influenced by the initial cluster assignments.
- **Algorithm Performance**: Although convergence is guaranteed, the rate of convergence depends on factors such as data distribution and the initial positions of centroids.

**Summary of the Convergence Proof**

In summary, Lloyd’s Algorithm will always converge, but the result may depend on initialization and may not provide the globally optimal clustering configuration.
