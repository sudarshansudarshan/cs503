**Question: Walk into Amritsar and estimate the ratio of men to women for a population of $$10^6$$.**
Write a code and observe this.



```
# create a list of length L of 1 million of randomly distributed numbers between one and zero with probability 0.21

import random

l = 10000
result = [0 if random.random() < 0.21 else 1 for _ in range(l)]
print(result)
```

```
#create another list with ith entry being the proportion of 0s seen so far, meaning, upto the ith position in the original list
# this can be done by using the cumulative sum of the original list, and then dividing by the index

result3 = [sum(result[:i])/i if i != 0 else 0 for i in range(1, l)]
print(result3)
```

```

def create_list(p_zero, n):
    import random
    return [random.choices([0, 1], weights=[p_zero, 1-p_zero])[0] for _ in range(n)]
# cumulative_proportion_ones(L): "Create a Python function in Colab that takes a list of 0s and 1s and returns the cumulative proportion of 1s at each position."
def cumulative_proportion_ones(L):
    return [sum(L[:i+1])/(i+1) for i in range(len(L))]

# create parameters p_zero, n, n_small, window_size
p_zero = 0.21
n = 10000
n_small = 10
window_size = 5

#Plotting Cumulative Proportion: "Write Python code in Colab to plot the cumulative proportion of 1s from a list generated with a specific zero probability using Matplotlib."

plt.show()

# Error Calculation: "Generate Python code in Colab to calculate and plot the error between the cumulative proportion of 1s and the expected value over time."
# Calculate errors

You have a biased coin. How or when will you get to know that the coin is biased, or how many steps will it take to know that the coin is biased?

It is given by:

$$
Pr(|\mu - \gamma| > \epsilon) \leq \frac{2}{e^{2 \epsilon^{2} N}}
$$

![Hoeffding’s Inequality](/assets/images/he.png)

Here, $$\epsilon$$ can be anything like 0.001 or 0.01, but on the right-hand side, $$\epsilon$$ is squared:

$$
\epsilon^2 \to 0
$$ 

This makes it very small, pulling the denominator of the right-hand side closer to 1, as you might expect! But **N** (the number of samples) pulls it up.

![Hoeffding’s Inequality](/assets/images/he2.png)

So, the chances of the difference between the true mean and your estimated mean being greater than $$\epsilon$$ are:

$$
\leq \frac{1}{e^{2 \epsilon^{2} N}}
$$

How do we apply this logic to our question?

You can see that with a very small **_N_**, convergence occurs quickly. Do you realize that the whole of this process is dependent on **N** and that there is an exponential dip?

Project:
A company has 100 employees, each rated in 10 distinct skills. Each employee's rating in a skill reflects their experience, expertise, and comfort in that skill, with values ranging from 0 to 100. The company wants to divide its employees into two groups of 50 each, such that the total skill levels for each group are identical across all 10 skills.

Your task is to divide the employees into two equal-sized groups (50 each) such that for every skill, the sum of the skill ratings in Group 1 is equal to the sum of the skill ratings in Group 2.
