# Choosing the Number of Clusters $$ K $$ in K-Means  

---

 **Introduction**  

In clustering tasks using the K-Means algorithm, the choice of $$ K $$ (the number of clusters) significantly impacts the quality of clustering. Since $$ K $$ is often not known in advance, this lecture outlines heuristic methods to determine an optimal $$ K $$, balancing the objective function value and penalizing excessive cluster numbers.

 **Objective Function in K-Means**  

The objective function in K-Means is defined as the **sum of squared distances** from each point to its assigned cluster center. Formally, for a given set of clusters $$ \{z_1, \dots, z_n\} $$:

$$
f(z_1, \dots, z_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \| x_i - \mu_{z_i} \|^2
$$

where $$ \mu_{z_i} $$ is the centroid of the cluster to which point $$ x_i $$ belongs. Lower objective values indicate tighter clusters, but without a penalty, setting $$ K = n $$ minimizes the objective function to zero, which is trivial and uninformative.

 **Balancing Objective and Penalty**  

To prevent choosing a trivially high $$ K $$, a penalty for the number of clusters is introduced. Thus, the total function to minimize becomes:

$$
\text{Total Objective} = \text{Objective Value} + \text{Penalty for K}
$$

The penalty function increases with $$ K $$, discouraging excessive clusters. A good choice for $$ K $$ minimizes this combined metric, achieving balance between minimizing the objective value and not using too many clusters.

 **Visualizing the Trade-Off: Objective vs. Penalty**  

A plot of **Objective Value + Penalty** against $$ K $$ typically shows a **decreasing trend** initially, where adding clusters reduces the objective significantly. However, as $$ K $$ grows, the penalty overtakes the gains in clustering quality, and the total cost starts to increase. The **optimal $$ K $$** is where the total cost reaches its minimum, denoted by $$ K^* $$.

 **Common Methods for Choosing $$ K $$**  

**1. AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)**  
The AIC criterion for determining $$ K $$ combines the objective value with a linear penalty on $$ K $$:

$$
\text{AIC} = 2K - 2 \cdot \log(\text{Likelihood})
$$

This method penalizes larger $$ K $$, helping select a model that balances complexity and fit to the data.

**2. BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)**  
The BIC criterion introduces a logarithmic dependency on $$ n $$ (number of data points) along with $$ K $$:

$$
\text{BIC} = K \log(n) - 2 \cdot \log(\text{Likelihood})
$$

The BIC criterion assumes a probabilistic model of data generation, offering a more conservative penalty for large datasets by favoring smaller $$ K $$ values.

**3. Elbow Method**  
The Elbow Method involves plotting the **objective value** against $$ K $$ and identifying the point where additional clusters result in diminishing improvements, creating an "elbow" shape. This elbow indicates the optimal $$ K $$ where adding clusters yields minimal gains in clustering quality.

 **Summary**  

1. **Objective Function**: Minimizing the sum of squared distances alone encourages high $$ K $$ but does not provide meaningful clusters.
2. **Penalization**: A penalty for $$ K $$ helps balance cluster compactness with a manageable number of clusters.
3. **Heuristic Methods**: Methods like AIC, BIC, and the Elbow Method assist in determining an effective $$ K $$, using a blend of statistical modeling and visualization.
