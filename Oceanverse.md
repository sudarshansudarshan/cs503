**Strictly use Geogebra to solve all the questions**

# Draft Module 0

* Create two points A and B

* Plot the vectors for the two points.

* Plot the segment of A and B.

* Find the distance between A and B.

* Create a unit circle.  

* Find the intersection points of the vector A and vector B. Hint: Use Segment(), while finding intersection.

* Find the dot product for these two new intersected vectors.

* Try changing the angle and see how the dot product changes.

* Explore the behavior of the quadratic function $$f(x)=x^2âˆ’4x+3$$. Determine its vertex, axis of symmetry, and roots.

* create an interection with y = 0 to find roots. vertex is already shown in geogebra.

* Parametric equation- create a point with parametric function trace them and observe the patterns. Try understanding the function.
